# Babylon.js Loaders

In this directory, we moved https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/tree/6.10.0/packages/dev/loaders with a change to use global `BABYLON` to reduce the bundle size.

## Plan

1. Use WebAssembly to speed up the loading and parsing these formats.
2. Supports USD format for Apple Vision Pro.
